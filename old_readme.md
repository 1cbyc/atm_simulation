#### 👋 I'm EMMANUEL Isaac, and over the last decade, I've spent more time studying and building websites, developing smart contracts, creating healthcare software, and designing systems for quantitative trading. Out of curiosity, I decided to enroll for another degree in mathematics. It's been a wonderful decade being a fullstack web developer, time to focus on doing more as a quant developer.
