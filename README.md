# atm_simulation
mastering java and i want to explore my understanding of java oop and file handling

For this ATM Simulation, I am taking a guide as seen, but I am considering utilizing some features.

- login/authentication (and storing it in users.txt)
- check balance
- deposit
- withdraw
- exit

although, i am considering adding a:
- save tx history to log file (transactions.txt)
- and implementing pin-based login too
