I am learning to write Java professionally and I want to understand what I'm doing while at it.

**Key Concepts I'm Practicing:**

- OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance if needed)
- Java I/O (reading/writing to files)
- User input (Scanner)
- Basic control flow (if/else, loops)

Seeing what I am learning, I feel like Java makes repetition severally. 

So, now I created dummy data for data/users.txt, and this places that my format is (account, pin, balance):

123456,1234,10000.0
789012,4321,5000.0
